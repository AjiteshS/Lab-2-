    <h1>My Favourite Reading: Shoe Dog</h1>

    <p>
        Hi My name is Ajitesh Sharma. One of my favourite recent readings has been "Shoe Dog" written by Nike's CEO, Phil Knight. <br>
        I read this book as I found an interest in business and business leadership. This book emphasizes quite a bit on what struggles and what <br>
    </p>

    <p> 
        Some of the most significant hurdles that stood out to me included when Phil had to travel almost 3 times to China to find the <br>
        most accurate supplier for Nike's desired shoe. Often times, Phil would face an issue where he would find a supplier that is cheap but had really poor quality <br>
        and other times the opposite was also true. Another struggle that stuck out to me in the book was when Phil struggled to find an athlete <br>
        to act as an ambassador for this shoe. What was amazing about this struggle was that the struggle did indeed pay off as the athlete who Phil <br>
        was able to land, eventually won gold in his Nike shoes.

        Some of the most memorable moments in this book included when Phil was able to impress his University coach with the overall performance of <br> 
        his Nike shoes. At the beginning, the coach did not originally believe in his idea but Phil was able to win over his coach and eventually sponsor <br> 
        his hometown team. Another memorable moment was when the Nike logo was created. The team relied on a college student to create not only a logo, <br> 
        but history.
